## Observations

1. Since there is a postive strong correlation on mouse weight v. average tumor volume we can infer that tumor size size accounts for a considerable amount of a mouse's weight as is causing increase in the weight of a mouse. 

2. Looking at the box plot and the bar graph,  the fact that the Capomulin and Ramicane treatments had more trials from the other other two top performing regimens, we can attribute this with Capomulin and Ramicanes out performance of the other two.  Considering ther were more test subject who had lower tumor volume average, we can infer that Capomulin and Ramican are the best regimens.

3. Looking at the line graph for test subject s185, we can infer that Capomulin is a successful treatment given that the tumor volume significantly declined over timepoint due to the Capomulin treatment.
